Welcome to Mobile World:

I've implemented a console input-based app/bot, which simulates an online Mobile store.

I've added more than 10 different models, with different specifications, prices & more.

if upgraded: 
It could be added new models and new features. 
It could be implemented an "in/out of stock" feature and sales report by managing the quantity values.

Finally, printing the ordered phone with its specifications.

could be runned in cmd or terminal.
Actually - my first project.
