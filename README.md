Welcome to Mobile World:

I've implemented a console input based app/bot, which simulates an online Mobile store.

I've added more than 10 different models, with different specifications.

if upgraded: could be added new models and new features. could be implemented "in/out of stock" feature and sales report by storing the quantity values.

Finally, printing the ordered phone with its specifications.
